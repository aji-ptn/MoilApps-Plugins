1. **Introduction**

   A plugin is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports plug-ins, it enables customization. 

   There are many benefits to building apps with a plugin framework:

   - 3rd party developers can create and extend upon your app
   - new features are easier to develop
   - your application becomes smaller and easier to understand

2. **How to use this apps**

   Before you install the Moildev app, you have to install Qt5 for the platform plugin, follow the steps for this installer
